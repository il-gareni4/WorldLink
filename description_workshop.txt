Has it ever happened to you that, having created many characters and worlds, you forgot which world and which character you usually play in? This mod will solve this problem with the ability to link the world to the character.

[h2]How to use this mod[/h2]
In order to [b]link a world to a character[/b], you need to select the character to which you want to link the world, then in the world selection menu in the list of buttons there will be a button with a chain icon, which allows you to link a world to the current character. Now in the character selection menu you can immediately launch the linked world.
To [b]unlink a world from a character[/b], you need to click on the link button again on the selected character in the list of worlds (this time the monk will have a cross).

In the config you can hide the display of the button if there is no world linked to the character
